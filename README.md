# ESP32 Trafic Light with Ultrasonic Sensor
******
## What does this project do?
****** 
This project effectively reads distances using an ultrasonic sensor and provides visible reaction through LEDs based on predefined distance thresholds. 
****


## A simple definition of an Ultrasonic Sensor
****
Briefly an ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves.

### Advantages:
- Non-contact: Does not require physical contact to measure distance.
- High Accuracy: Provides precise distance measurements.
- Versatility: Can be used in various conditions and environments.

### Applications:
- Distance Measurement.
- Object Detection and Avoidance.
- Liquid Level Measurement.
- Presence Sensing.
